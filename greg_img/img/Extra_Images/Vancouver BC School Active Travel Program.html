				<h3>School Active Travel Planning has many benefits for students, the community, and the environment, including:
				</h3>
				
				<p>Increasing physical activity among students, leading to healthier, happier, and more alert learners</p>

				<p>Creating opportunities to engage with neighbours and socialize on the way to school</p>

				<p>Reducing car travel to school, in turn decreasing traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution</p>

				<p>Inspiring active travel	habits early in life to carry into adulthood</p>
